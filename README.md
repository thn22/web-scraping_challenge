# web-scraping_challenge
## Description of the Project
For this project, I was tasked to web-scrape the MARS Planet Science website to collect the titles and previews of each article on its main page. After passing that hurdle, I was tasked to scrape and analyze weather data taken by the Curiosity rover on Mars. By manipulating the data, I was able to answer this challenge's questions. 

## Languages and Libraries
